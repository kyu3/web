<h2> Music Recommendations </h2>
<p> Everyone has their own unique music opinions, but sometimes mine are cooler than others.
  Some of my favorite artists/groups/collectives are 88Rising, Brockhampton, Lauv, and Jeremy Zucker.
88Rising is an international music collective primarily featuring Asian-American and Asian artists, such
as the rap group Higher Brothers, singers NIKI and Joji, and rapper/singer Rich Brian. Some of their
best songs as a group and as individual members include Midsummer Madness, La La Lost You (NIKI), Drive Safe (Rich Brian),
Slow Dancing in the Dark (Joji), and Pretty Boy (Joji).</p>
<p>Brockhampton is a self-defined boy band that puts out hip hop and pop music. They feature a diverse
   roster, which is a large part of their distinctive lyrics and sound. The group has 7 active members and 5
 released albums since their formation in 2010. Some of their best songs are Sugar, 1999 Wildfire, St. Percy,
and Gold </p>
<p>Lauv and Jeremy Zucker are both independent pop artists. Their songs uniquely cover topics such as love and mental health
  in their own unique ways. Both gained their popularity in the last five years with Lauv's <i> I Met You When I Was 18 </i>album
  and Jeremy Zucker's EPs released since 2015. Their best songs include Lauv's Fake, Dishes, Paris in the Rain, and Tattoos Together
  and Jeremy Zucker's comethru, all the kids are depressed, and not ur friend. </p>

<h2> Playing and Learning On Your Own </h2>
Learning how to play music isn't that hard once you learn sheet music and how to read it. Usually, you only have to know how to read
the notes on one clef (two if you're playing piano). From there, you just have to learn the tempo and volume indicators and make sure
you actually know how to keep rhythm and keep tempo. There are a few ways to learn an instrument, the two most common being taking classes
and self-teaching yourself using the internet. Taking lessons can include getting a private teacher or learning from a class at school while
self-teaching online can be finding a website with a structured lesson system or going on YouTube to look for tutorials. </p>
<p> Here's a good site for free sheet music if you want to practice: <a href = "https://musescore.org/en"> MuseScore </a>
<h2> Streaming and Listening </h2>
<p> Today, music is extremely portable, being able to be stored on your phone or on the cloud. You have multiple options for listening
  and enjoying your music, including converting songs to MP3 files and using a streaming service. Streaming services are apps like
  Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and Pandora. However, they usually are filled with ads and force you to pay a
  monthly subscription to listen to ad-free music. Converting songs to MP3s is a way to get around that. You can look up a YouTube
  video of the song and find a converting site (I use <a href = https://ytmp3.cc/en13/> ytmp3</a>) and download the file to your phone.
  All you have to do now is find a music player app. </p>
